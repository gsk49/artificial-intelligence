iris.csv is read by nMeans.py, iris2.csv is read by neuralNetwork.py.

They are basically the same file, but I switched up how I wanted to read the files by the time I got to neuralNetwork.py, so iris2.csv has headers to
organize the data.

Pretty simple to run, just download and compile, make sure the folders point to the correct place.
